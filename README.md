#### By **John Maronga, Geoffrey Chege, Brendah Koro, Victoria Maina, Daisy Lynn Wanjiru, Joshua Kibuye**
## Description
A repository containing a detailed analysis of used car prices as well as a model used to predict the price of used cars.
## Business problem
Buying a car even if itâ€™s not new can be a stressful decision to make since there are so many factors to look at and consider especially since it has been realized that the price of cars keeps on changing depending on which features matter the most to clients when buying a car.
Thus, a need to come up with a  model that can predict price of used cars.

## Objectives
To predict the selling price of used cars
